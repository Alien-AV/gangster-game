# Gangster Game Prototype

This repository contains a very small prototype for a mafia management game. The game is a semi-idle experiment inspired by games like **Cultist Simulator**. Gameplay revolves around balancing money, manpower and heat while expanding your criminal empire.

For a high level overview of the gameplay ideas, see [game-design.md](game-design.md).

## How to run

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step or server is required.

You start with only the ability to extort with the boss. As you perform actions new options will unlock. Mooks automatically patrol your territory, so you only need to recruit them. Hire lieutenants and buy businesses as you expand. Progress bars show how long each action takes.

This prototype intentionally uses a very minimal user interface to focus purely on testing the core gameplay loop.

## Deployment

Changes merged into `main` are automatically published to **GitHub Pages**
using the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. Once the action
completes, the game will be available at
`https://<username>.github.io/gangster-game/`.
